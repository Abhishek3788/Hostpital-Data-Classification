# 🏥 Hospital Data Text Classification using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to classify hospital-related textual data using TensorFlow. The dataset contains patient/hospital records (anonymized), and the goal is to classify the text into categories such as **diagnosis**, **treatment type**, **department**, etc.

## 🚀 Project Features

- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras
- Train-test-validation split
- Model performance evaluation (accuracy, loss, precision, recall)
- Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Graphs, and Loss Curves
- Export model for production use

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized hospital records in the form of text, each labeled with a specific category.  

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Input Layer (Tokenized Text)
- Embedding Layer
- LSTM / GRU Layer (optional)
- Dense Layers
- Output Layer with Softmax Activation

## 📈 Results

- **Accuracy:** XX% (on test data)
- **Loss:** XX
- Confusion matrix and performance graphs included in `/visualizations` folder
